Design
======================================
    The system contains an image comparison technique which compares pixel by pixel
considering the red,green and blue separately producing a total difference in the two
images. The image url is given in the inputs and then a preview is displayed in the
interface. Compare button is to be clicked to evaluate the result.

Dependencies
======================================
    Coding is done using NetBeans IDE 6.9.1 and Notepad++. WampServer 2.0 is used as the
webserver.The PHP is to be compiled with GD,which is done in versions over 5.1 .

Usage
======================================
    Code is put in the www directory of the wampserver. Localhost is run on browser and
project code start.php is run, which provides the so called interface. Entering the urls
in the given inputs will provide a preview. Clicking on the compare button will produce
comparison output. The images are to be of same Dimensions as the system compares
pixel by pixel.ie, Same Height and Same Width.
