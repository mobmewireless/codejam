DESIGN:

Invariant_tdd.py contains the test driven developement tests after which modules
are written.In invariant_algorithm.py file, the function dynamic_prog that counts 
the no of iterations for a number to reach 6174. The invariant_main.py contains the
 main  which runs to give output to the problem.
Invariant_print_table.py contains module to print the frequency table
