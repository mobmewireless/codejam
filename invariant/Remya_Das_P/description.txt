Description:
1. iteration is done from 1000 to 9998.
2. each digit of that particular 4 digit number is taken and put into an array.
3. array is sorted in ascending order using bubble sort.
4. a variable is assigned to identify the number of iterations performed.
5. two variables are initialized to assign the values in ascending and descending orders respectively.
6. the number in ascending order is subtracted from the number in descending order, the result is now compared with 6174.
7. if there is an eqality then the loop is exited and the count value is displayed.
8. else the loop is executed again with the result obtained from step 6.
