Design
------
1) List of required numbers is made first(instead of looping from 1000 to 9999 & comparing each number) for efficiency.
2) Iteration_counter function is used to find out number of iterations for each number.
3) Then according to number of iterations the count is entered into the iteration_dictionary.

Dependencies
------------
Python 2.x


Usage
-----
$ python invariant.py
