Design	:	The program is witten in python

			 Data sturcture mainly used "list"

			 STARTS
			 
		step 1 : Find the numbers that follows the following condintions as mentioned in question and store the output 
			 to a list.
		step 2 : Sort the numbers and store it in different varuable as mentioned in question 
			 find the iterations taken by each number to yeild sum = 6174 as mentioned in question
			 store those count to a freq[] list
		step 3 : find the count of freqencies from list using built in list function eg : freq.count(0) 
			 and store it in another list. Output frequency distribution table. 
		step 4 : get the data for chart from the freq[] list and sort[] list
		step 5 : output chart to the file graph.png
			 
			 ENDS
