1. Dynamic Nature

Task : The menu shown might be different on each day. So we should be able to add new FSMs easily. 

Solution : In the directory 'config', a settings file is kept. 
It has a key-value pair that saves the name of the current service available via USSD.

Eg. 

		Open config>settings

		module=CapitalQuiz

This means that currently the service being offered is 'CapitalQuiz'.

2. Representing a Service

Say our USSD service for today is a quiz, say Capital Quiz.
The entire FSM for the quiz can be represented in a text file. It should be saved in the directory   'USSDEngine'

(Open USSDEngine to find a few sample Services)

Eg.  Currently our 'module' is set to 'CapitalQuiz'. Hence in the directory 'USSDModules', a file with the FSM should be present with the same name 'CapitalQuiz'


3. Representing an FSM in a text file

Say our menu is like this :

Language?
 	1. English
		1. Movies
			-Subscribed to Movies
		2. Music
			-Subscribed to Music
	2. Malayalam
		1. Cinema
			-Subscribed to Cinema
		2. Audio
			-Subscribed to Audio

Then the text file for FSM will be as follows :

level0=Language?\n 1. English\n 2. Malayalam\n
error=invalid
level0_1=1. Movies\n2. Music
level0_2=1. Cinema\n2. Audio
level01_1=Subscribed to Movies!
level01_2=Subscribed to Actors!
level02_1=Subscribed to Cinema!
level02_2=Subscribed to Nadanmar!



level0 = MAIN MENU

level0_x = Text to be showed when User presses x from level0
level0x_y = User pressed x from main menu to reach next state (level0x). Text to be shown if he pressed y after that.


The field 'error' is the error message to be shown if any incorrect state is reached!


Hence, with the above representation, any problem can be mapped as a FSM.
