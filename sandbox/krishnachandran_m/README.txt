Design
======================================
    The system consists of a backing file servercommands.php which services the requests
given to it. The main page contains a command_box and an Output_box. Client could enter
the commands in the command_box and get the response from server in Output_box.

Dependencies
======================================
    Coding is done using NetBeans IDE 6.9.1 and Notepad++. WampServer 2.0 is used as the
webserver.

Usage
======================================
    Code is put in the www directory of the wampserver. Localhost is run on browser and
project code start.php is run, which provides the so called interface.Enter the commands
and get outputs. The file are generated with random_name with time as content. It is not
indicated externally, still can be detected by list command.
