Design:

Consist of three modules.
search.py : This is the main file.The populate_index() function using the urllib2 module
			web pages in mobme.in is read, converted to text using html2text function from
			data_extractor.py and then search index is populated using the generate_index()
			method of database.CreateDb.The search_word() function in this modules uses the
			search() of database.CreateDb class and prints the result in order of occurence.
			class. 
database.py : This module consists of the 'CreateDb' class. This class provides 
			  method for updating, searching and checking existence of the database file.
data_extractor.py : This module consists the html2text function which helps to extract
					text from raw html.
					
Uses sqlite3 as database.First all the web page data are fetched from mobme.in and index is 
created.Then the database is queried for the search keyword and results are printed in order
of occurrence.

Dependencies:

No specific dependencies.


Usage:

First run 
$ python search.py -u
or 
$ python search.py --update
to index the pages and update the database

To search for keyword
$ python search.py -s <keyword>

For multiple word keywords use double quotes
