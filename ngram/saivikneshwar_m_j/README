A.Design:
We take in the entire book or article as a single string. Then we initialise a two-dimensional string to store each and every trigram in the text. Then we pick a random index to traverse till the end in the 2-D array of trigrams in order to get the desired output.

B.Dependencies:
Only a gcc 4.3.2 compiler is required. It is to note that this program has been done on a LINUX environment.

C.Usage:
This contains a single source file and should be run using the command:gcc -Wall ngram.c
The executable command is: 
./a.out<sample.txt>smaple2.txt
It reads from sample.txt,a portion of a wikipedia article on factorials and then writes into smaple2.txt.
