description:
i have taken a text file(story.txt) and made trigram and stored it in file trigram.txt. 
after making this, by retrieving each trigram from the trigram file i have made a story.
the user will have to enter the trigram from which he wants to start the story.story is
shown on screen(console) according to number of words u entered.

installation:
i'm using window7(dosbox);

uses:
suppose the story in text file is not written properly or there is lots of space wasted.
then we can use this method to rearange the words in systematic manner.also here we have 
independence of reading any part of page and we can also specify the number of words.
