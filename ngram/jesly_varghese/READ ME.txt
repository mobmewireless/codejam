	[DESIGN]


I have used the concept of doubly linked list to store the trigrams.

trigram->first - first word of trigram
trigram->second - second "   "   "
trigram->third - third "    "   "

Once the trigrams get stored, they are processed for vowels, periods at end of third word, caps at begining of trigram, so the generated story will make some sense.

Periods are give the most priority, next vowels and then not closed double quotes. Though sometimes everything goes crazy

The search for next trigram is done in forward direction towards end, this is done so the o/p will have sense. Mostly they don't have.. :P

If end is reached while searching it restarts from head

The program often crashes due to segmentation fault. This happens rarely, but try re running
 +revision additions: the crashes have been removed. No crashes or all the test i done after updation
 +now the o/p story is within word limits.. :)
 *this revision wont crash and works well in gcc. No dev c++ needed. Just a linux system and gcc ngram -lm command will do it all:)

The starting of story trigram is searched randomly also are the next trigrams.


	[DEPENDENCIES]


GCC and its libraries.
MINGW is needed.
Install DEV C++ thats the best option.
Nothing normally the gcc compiler should work.
Programmed this with DEV C++

	[USAGE]


A chapter from some book should be copied to a text file same as the folder in which the program resides.

Start the program

Enter the filename along with its extension and press enter.

The o/p will be written to same folder

Already 3 i/p files has been included with:
 time.txt
 another.txt
