DESIGN

The program gets the system time.
It then extracts the current minute and hour and spells it out.

main function gets system time and then calls print_minutes and
print_hour function. All this is done within an infinite loop.

DEPENDENCIES

Any C compiler.

USAGE

The user has to first enter the number of minutes(limited to 60 for 
demonstration purpose) for which the clock has to run. The clock then 
shows the time for that many minutes.
