Design:
Question:-
Implement a clock that spells out time with fuzziness. For example, 2:43 would show as It is almost fifteen to three.

This program does almost exactly what the hint website:helvetictoc.com does.
fuzziness is impemented using the random function

Dependencies: python 2.7.2
modules used: random,sys,time,datetime

Usage:python clock.py <time_in_24_hr_format hr:min > // to output for given time
      python clock.py //to output the current system time
