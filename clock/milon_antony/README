Design:
Question:-
Implement a clock that spells out time with fuzziness. For example, 2:43 would show as It is almost fifteen to three.

This program does almost exactly what the hint website:helvetictoc.com does.
Fuzziness is impemented by the program.

Dependencies: GNU C compiler

Usage: Run the program. The program keeps on running infinitely, takes the system time and displays it using the fuzzy logic.
