a)Design
--------
    The script makes use of php GD library. It outputs the image to current 
    output stream or save to a file. 
    
    If php GD library have anti aliasing support then we can enable that for much
    better render.Currently anti aliasing is not enabled in the script.

    The output is in JPEG format but it can be changed to other format if necessary
    with a few modification in the script.
    
b)Dependencies
--------------
    PHP needs GD Library support. Most of the php distribution compiled with it.

c)Usage
-------
    
    php flag.php filename
    
    Filename argument is optional. If not present the script will output to the 
    current output stream

   for example: 
        php flag.php | display       
        will open the image in ImageMagick picture viewer
