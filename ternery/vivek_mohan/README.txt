Design
========
	This is a program for performing the codejam question "invariant"  .
	the first section of program generates the required 4 digit numbers with out any if statments.
	thus gives fast execution time. 
		second phase makes an efficient loop to do the iteration
	the third phase does simple procedure to create table.. though it can be implimented with better datastructure.
Dependencies
==============
 python 2.3 or above recommended
 Usage
 =====
	python invariant.py
