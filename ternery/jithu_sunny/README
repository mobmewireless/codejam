Design
------
1) The number generator program - 'numgen.py' prints out random 10-digit numbers into 'stdout'.

2) The filter program - 'filter.py' reads input from 'stdin' & stores it in corrensponding 'n.txt' file.

    -Both 'numgen.py' & 'filter.py' can be executed simultaneously with output from 'numgen.py' going in as the input for 'filter.py' using UNIX pipe.

3) The number-count-watcher program - 'countwatch.py' when run, checks and prints the number of numbers in each file in each second.

Dependencies
------------
Python 2.x


Usage
-----
To run the 'count-watcher' program - $ python countwatch.py

The UNIX pipe can be used to run the 'number-generator' & 'filter' programs as required. $ python numgen.py | python filter.py
