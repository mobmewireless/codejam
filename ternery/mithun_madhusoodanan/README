Question:
	Write a number generator that keeps printing out 10 digit numbers, one in each line. Write a second program called filter that takes the output of this number generator and filters it based on its first digit: if the first digit starts with 0, write it to a file named 0.txt, if the first digit is 1, write it to a file named 1.txt, and so on. Write a third program that when run keeps a watch on these files and prints out the count of numbers in these files every second.
	
Design:
	1) generator.py when run will start writing a 10digit number to random.txt. 
	2) filter.py when run will read random.txt and filters the 10 digit number according to the 1st digit and saves it to its respective text file(1.txt/2.txt....)
	3) watch.py reads all the text file which filter created and prints the number of 10 digit numbers contained in the each of the text files from 1.txt to 9.txt


Dependencies:
	python 2.7

Usage:
	1) Run generator.py
	2) Run filter.py
	3) Run watch.py
	to run a .py file

		$python filename.py
		eg:
			$python generator.py
