				*******************************
Design :
		ternary.c
			It is where execution starts. 
			The code takes a long int number n and outputs it into a file
			The two pipes are used, which reades the output from main and implements the objective
			(One pipe is ment for only reading and exe code(filter.c),While other exexcutes and prints output from code 
			(count.c))
			The count is the incremented to the required limit(9999999999)
			suitable delay of 1sec is also given
		filter.c
			This program filter the main program output and stores the numbers in seperate files.
		count.c
			Thic program counts the numbers in each file seperatly and outputs the result.

		/* More Detailed explation are give as comments in between the code */

				**********************************
				
Dependencies:
				GCC(GNU Compiler Collection)	


				*********************************
Usage :
				
				(Use minimized window. It will look better)
				(Eitor used - gedit)
				
				cc filter.c -o filter.exe
				cc count.c -o count.exe
				cc ternay.c -o ternary
				./ternary
