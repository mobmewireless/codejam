# Design #

Note runs only on linux machine.

Contains 3 files.
* gen.py:
    Generates random numbers using the random function. Multiplies each number by 10^10. Prints each such number on the STDOUT. It continues till we give a key board interrupt after which it terminates.

* read.cpp:
    Opens a file for each bin. Reads from STDIN a string which should be a number. Writes to that file according to the starting digit.

* pcount.py:
    Uses the system call to count lines in the file. Sleeps for 10 secs and after that counts the lines in the files.

# Dependencies #

* Linux machine.
* G++ version 4.5.1
* Python 2.7 -> Modules used 
                * command
                * time
                * random
                They are mostly inbuilt.

# Usage #
* gen.py can run independently and print the 10 digit numbers.
* pcount.py can run independently and counts the lines in required files.
* read.cpp when compiled runs independently to accept numbers and write to a file.

## Commands ##
1. $g++ -o filter read.py
2. $chmod a+x gen.py
3. $chmod a+x pcount.py
4. $chmod a+x filter
5. $./gen.py | ./filter
6. $./pcount

Note: * Put command 5 in background. You can always open a new shell to run command 6.
